## Intro and Things to Note

These notes were written by me, [Mark Ormesher](http://www.markormesher.co.uk), during my revision for *Computer Science BSc* exams at *King's College London*. I am publishing them here to help my classmates and other students in the years below me. To the best of my knowledge they are correct, however please note the following:

- These notes are **not endorsed** by King's College London, the module lecturers, or any member of College staff.
- These notes are **not checked** by any qualified individual, and I offer no guarantee as to how accurate or complete these notes are. They are offered for free, as-is, and I accept no responsibility for how you choose to use them.
- These notes were relevant for my year, but **the content for your course may have changed**. Check your lecture slides, syllabi, tutorial guides, etc.
- These notes were produced for personal use (it's how I like to revise) and sharing them was an afterthough. That means that the handwriting is scruffy, some annotations may by irrelevant, and some topics might be skipped entirely.
- There are no notes for management modules, robotics, etc. Sorry!
